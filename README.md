Custom themes for Sprites
=========================

[Sprites](https://spritesapp.com) allows its user to give their infographics a unique look by introducing a concept of _custom themes_. A custom theme allows you to make your infographic look exactly like you envisioned and helps you to produce a more targeted content.

The purpose of this repository is to allow web-designers to create their own themes for Sprites. All you need to do is to fork this repository, add a new theme and then submit a pull request.

Check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/spritesapp/sprites-themes/wiki/Introduction) in order to get started with custom theme creation. If you'd like to get in touch with us, the ["Feedback"](https://github.com/spritesapp/sprites-themes/wiki/Your-feedback) section has all the relevant information (or you can just use the form at [spritesapp.com/feedback](https://spritesapp.com/feedback)).
